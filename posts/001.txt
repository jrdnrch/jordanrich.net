This is a first post It’s easy to start something, come back and edit it. It’s hard to put it down, and leave it as is “mistakes and all”. There’s an honesty about one take. Similar to writing in pen on paper, painting, recording music on tape, using a typewriter. It requires a focus and awareness of oneself in that moment.

Today, marks a day where I intend to take the “1 Take” approach to my work. There is so much unfinished work and ideas I’ve been blessed with that should be shared. I belive, that each of us have very important things to share with one another, that add value and abundance to the world. This would explain why the world is the way that it is. Not enough people are sharing what they have in an authentic way uncompromised by society. What I’ve just stated is not a (everyone deserves a trophy everyone is super special…) cop out. It’s merely a way to state that we all have the oppourtunity to add value to this world, but it’s on you whether or not you will allow your value to decay and expire along with your body adding to the decay of a dieing world or to bring and nurture life on a planet yearing to be renewed.

One must think for themselves but not of themeselves.

I dedicate this first post and this website to the creator of all things. Whom without him was not any thing made that was made.

Lord be with you to all who read this, for the time is at hand.
